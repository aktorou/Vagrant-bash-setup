# Vagrant bash script setup

Thought I'd try my hand at a bash script to automate the setup of a vagrant box using Ubuntu 14.04 trusty64.
The script installs the following:

- Apache 2
- MySQL
- PHP
- phpMyAdmin

It also creates a link between the vagrant shared files to the web root. This allows easy editing from the host computer.
